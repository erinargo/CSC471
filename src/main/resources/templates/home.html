    To get started look at the navbar at the top and make your selection. You can create however many of those options
    that you want and once you've done that you have options.
    For employees you can assign dependents to them that have a name and a date of birth.
    You can also assign employees to departments. Departments can have a manager which can be any employee.
    One manager per department and many employees to many departments.
    Projects can be assigned to many departments as well and many departments can have many projects. This kind of relationship is called Many to Many.
    The same manager can manage many different departments but any given department can only have one manager. This is a
    One (Manager) to Many (Departments) relationship. Certain checks have been put into place to make sure a user doesn't make an error that
    jeopardizes the system.
